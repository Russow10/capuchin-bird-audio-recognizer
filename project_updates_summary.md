# Project Updates Summary

The Capuchin Bird Audio Recognizer has undergone significant improvements to enhance its functionality and user experience. We transformed the application from a basic call counter to a comprehensive audio recognition system with a modern, intuitive interface. Key upgrades include visual enhancements with consistent styling across feature panels, improved navigation with a dark-themed sidebar, and direct visualization of audio waveforms upon upload. The results page now displays precise timestamps of detected calls with an interactive timeline and exportable data instead of raw logs. We added a professional About page with project information and GitHub repository links, and renamed the application to better reflect its sophisticated audio analysis capabilities. Documentation was also enhanced with detailed requirements and an updated README. These improvements create a more cohesive, user-friendly tool for ornithologists and conservationists studying Capuchin birds.
